# Quizzler - The Simple Quiz App 
So this App is another one taught through Angela Yu's iOS course on Udemy. Essentially, she gave my the assets for the quiz, and using her tutorials, I was able to create a working quiz app. 

This app was made through Xcode using Swift 4. 

## What I learned

The key concepts I learned while making this project: 

- Importing libraries into my files 
- Understanding Object-Oriented Programming in Swift
- How the Model, View, and Controller interact with one another
- Using the debug console in Xcode
- Implementing Pop-up UI into my app project
